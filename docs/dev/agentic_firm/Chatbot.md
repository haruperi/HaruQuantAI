# HaruQuant CEO Chatbot Implementation Plan

Status: canonical feature implementation plan  
Scope: phased delivery plan for converting the HaruQuant global AI chatbot into the front door of the HaruQuant Agentic Trading Firm  
Use this when: implementing the global chat UI, CEO Agent routing, conversation memory, page context, tool wrappers, agent orchestration, supervised actions, paper automation, prop-firm controls, and production rollout

## 1. Purpose

This document updates the old HaruQuant AI Chatbot Implementation Plan into the new Agentic Trading Firm architecture.

The original chatbot plan introduced a global, context-aware AI assistant for HaruQuant. The updated plan keeps the same useful foundations — global widget, persistent conversations, page context, streaming, tool grounding, UX maturity, retrieval, observability, and rollout — but changes the core role of the chatbot:

> The chat is no longer just a generic trading copilot. The chat is the user-facing interface to the HaruQuant CEO Agent.

The CEO Agent is the main conversational entry point into the HaruQuant Agentic Trading Firm. It receives user requests, interprets current page context, plans work, delegates to specialist agents, calls safe tools through permissioned wrappers, reads HaruQuant services, and returns final memos, recommendations, reports, drafts, or approval requests.

The chatbot must therefore support two realities at once:

1. A smooth global chat experience across the HaruQuant UI.
2. A controlled agentic-firm workflow where all meaningful work is routed through the CEO Agent, Planner Agent, tools, services, RiskGovernor, audit system, and lifecycle policies.

---

## 2. Strategic Goals

1. Provide a persistent AI chat interface available on every authenticated HaruQuant page.
2. Make the chat interface the front door to the `CEOAgent`, not a standalone chatbot.
3. Preserve conversation continuity across navigation while injecting current page context.
4. Ground every response in HaruQuant services, current page state, internal documents, reports, simulations, strategy records, and risk state.
5. Route all domain work through the Agentic Trading Firm architecture:
   - CEO Agent
   - Planner Agent
   - Research Agent
   - Strategy Creator Agent
   - Strategy Reviewer Agent
   - Codegen Agent
   - Simulation Agent
   - Simulation Analyst Agent
   - Risk Reviewer Agent
   - Reporter Agent
   - Audit Agent
   - Later: Robustness, Portfolio Manager, Execution Agent
6. Preserve strict boundaries between conversation memory, page context, tools, services, agents, RiskGovernor, human approvals, and execution.
7. Support early value through read-only intelligence, strategy explanation, simulation interpretation, risk explanation, and report generation before any side-effectful actions.
8. Progress safely from CEO chat to tool-assisted analysis, then supervised drafts, then paper-trading automation, and only later tightly gated live execution.
9. Preserve prop-firm compliance:
   - 5% max daily loss,
   - 10% static total loss,
   - 10% profit target cycle/month,
   - high-impact news restriction window,
   - weekend/overnight restrictions,
   - forbidden practices,
   - EA/automation compliance,
   - allocation compliance,
   - Best Day Rule / consistency score.
10. Make every tool call, agent decision, draft action, approval, rejection, simulation, and execution attempt auditable.

## 3. Key Architectural Change

### Old model

```text
Global Chatbot
  -> Context Service
  -> AI Gateway
  -> Tools
  -> Optional workflow/action layer
```

### New model

```text
Global Chat UI
  -> Chat API
  -> Conversation Service
  -> Page Context Service
  -> CEO Agent
      -> Planner Agent
      -> Specialist Agent(s)
      -> Tool wrapper(s)
      -> HaruQuant services/
      -> Audit
      -> Final CEO response
```

The chat system is not the intelligence layer by itself. It is a delivery channel for the CEO Agent.

The CEO Agent is not allowed to bypass tools, services, governance, RiskGovernor, audit, lifecycle, or human approval. It can coordinate, explain, delegate, recommend, draft, and request approvals.

---

## 4. Planning Assumptions

- HaruQuant uses the simplified architecture with top-level `services/`, `tools/`, `agents/`, `api/`, and `ui/`.
- MCP is intentionally skipped for now.
- HaruQuant exposes a clean public Python API through `import haruquant as hqt`.
- Internal agents call permissioned tool wrappers.
- Tool wrappers call HaruQuant services.
- Services contain business logic.
- The simulation/backtest engine lives inside `services/simulation/`.
- Prompts live inside `agents/prompts/`.
- The global chat widget is always mounted in the UI shell.
- Page context is additive and ephemeral.
- Conversation memory is durable.
- Current system state is more authoritative than prior chat memory.
- Direct LLM-to-broker execution is prohibited.
- Live execution cannot be enabled without approved strategy lifecycle status, RiskGovernor approval, prop-firm compliance checks, kill-switch health, audit logging, and human Board approval where required.
- All side effects must be idempotent or protected against duplicate execution.
- Production readiness requires observability, RBAC, retention, rollback, prompt-injection controls, cost control, and policy enforcement.

---

## 5. Updated Ownership Model

| Role | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| Product Owner | Scope, prioritization, rollout, Board approval workflow |
| AI Platform Lead | CEO Agent, Planner, orchestration, prompts, model routing, evaluation |
| Backend Lead | Services, API endpoints, conversation backend, context service, persistence |
| Frontend Lead | Global chat widget, page context provider, streaming UI, approval UI |
| Quant / Risk Lead | RiskGovernor, prop-firm rules, strategy lifecycle, simulation validity, risk memos |
| Agent Tools Lead | Tool registry, permissions, schemas, audit wrappers, tool safety |
| DevOps / SRE | Deployment, monitoring, scaling, secrets, worker infrastructure |
| QA Lead | Unit, integration, acceptance, regression, red-team test coverage |
| Security / Compliance Owner | RBAC, audit, prompt injection, data leakage, permission and approval review |

Note: the old `MCP / Tooling Lead` role is replaced with `Agent Tools Lead` because this phase intentionally skips MCP.

# Phase 0 - Agentic Chat Architecture Alignment

## Objective

Establish the architecture, boundaries, schemas, and governance rules for the CEO-facing chatbot before implementation.

## Key update from old plan

The chatbot is no longer the primary intelligence. The `CEOAgent` is the primary intelligence. The chat is the UI and transport layer.

## Tasks

1. Approve the CEO-chat architecture:
   - `ui/` global chat widget,
   - `app/routes/chat.py`,
   - `services/conversation/`,
   - `services/context/`,
   - `agents/ceo.py`,
   - `agents/planner.py`,
   - `tools/`,
   - `services/`.
2. Freeze the `ChatThread` schema.
3. Freeze the `ChatMessage` schema.
4. Freeze the `PageContext` schema.
5. Freeze the `AgentTask` schema.
6. Freeze the `AgentPlan` schema.
7. Freeze the `ToolCall` schema.
8. Freeze the `EvidenceRef` schema.
9. Define chat-to-agent routing:
   - all user chat starts with `CEOAgent`,
   - CEO may delegate to Planner,
   - Planner may route to specialist agents,
   - specialist agents may call tools,
   - tools call services.
10. Define safety boundary:
    - free-form chat cannot place live orders,
    - agents cannot call services directly,
    - agents must call permissioned tools,
    - tools must audit,
    - critical tools must enforce RiskGovernor and approval requirements.
11. Replace old tool tier labels with HaruQuant tool tiers:
    - read-only,
    - analysis/write,
    - critical,
    - human-approval required,
    - RiskGovernor required.
12. Define response modes:
    - direct CEO answer,
    - page-aware summary,
    - evidence-grounded explanation,
    - research memo,
    - strategy spec draft,
    - simulation report,
    - risk memo,
    - action draft,
    - approval request,
    - blocked-by-policy response.
13. Define observability and audit baseline.
14. Define rollout gates.

# 9. Cross-Phase Standards

## Required architectural rules

- Chat UI must remain globally mounted.
- Chat always talks to the CEO Agent first.
- CEO Agent may delegate but cannot bypass Planner, tool policy, RiskGovernor, or audit.
- Conversation memory must be durable and separate from page context.
- Page context must be structured, compact, versioned, and freshness-marked.
- Current system state is more authoritative than prior chat memory.
- Agents may generate proposals and drafts; they may not directly mutate live broker state.
- All tool calls must pass allowlist policy.
- All tool calls must be audited.
- Critical tools require approval and/or RiskGovernor checks.
- Live execution cannot be enabled without full governance.
- MCP is out of scope for this version.

## Required quality standards

- Unit tests for all services.
- Unit tests for all tool wrappers.
- Integration tests for CEO chat continuity.
- Integration tests for agent delegation.
- Contract tests for schemas.
- Security tests for prompt injection.
- Security tests for privilege escalation.
- Security tests for data leakage.
- Regression tests for RBAC and action gating.
- Acceptance tests for page context.
- Red-team tests for forbidden tool use.

## Required UX standards

- Fast first render for widget.
- Responsive mobile fallback.
- Clear user-visible states:
  - thinking,
  - planning,
  - using tools,
  - delegating,
  - waiting for approval,
  - blocked by policy,
  - error,
  - completed.
- No silent failures.
- Every approval request must explain why approval is required.
- Every blocked action must explain the blocking policy.

# 12. Recommended Execution Order

If capacity is limited, execute in this order:

1. Phase 0 - Agentic Chat Architecture Alignment
2. Phase 1 - Global CEO Chat Widget
3. Phase 2 - Conversations, Memory, and Thread Continuity
4. Phase 3 - Page Context Injection
5. Phase 4 - CEO Agent Gateway and Streaming Orchestration
6. Phase 5 - Tool Registry and Permissioned Read-Only Tools
7. Phase 6 - UX Maturity and Conversation Operations
8. Phase 7 - Agentic Trading Intelligence
9. Phase 8 - Strategy Creation and Simulation Workflow
10. Phase 9 - Risk, Prop-Firm, and Lifecycle Governance
11. Phase 10 - Internal Knowledge and Evidence Retrieval
12. Phase 13 - Observability, Latency, Cost, and Scale
13. Phase 11 - Supervised Action Drafts and Board Approval Queue
14. Phase 12 - Governed Paper Automation
15. Phase 14 - Certification, Rollout, and Operations

# 14. Program Definition of Done

The CEO Chatbot initiative is complete when:

1. The assistant is globally available and persistent.
2. The chat talks to the HaruQuant CEO Agent by default.
3. The CEO Agent retains durable thread memory while correctly using current page context.
4. The CEO Agent answers using grounded HaruQuant services, reports, memory, and internal knowledge.
5. The CEO Agent delegates to specialist agents for strategy, simulation, analytics, risk, reporting, and audit.
6. The CEO Agent can create structured strategy specs, simulation requests, risk memos, reports, and supervised action drafts.
7. No trading action can bypass risk, audit, approval, lifecycle, or execution governance.
8. Prop-firm risk controls are enforced before any paper or live execution workflow.
9. Paper automation is controlled, observable, replayable, and reversible.
10. Production telemetry, cost tracking, support runbooks, and rollback paths are in place.

---

# 15. Governing Principle

The CEO Agent must remember the conversation, but it must trust current HaruQuant system state more than prior chat memory.

The CEO Agent may recommend, summarize, delegate, draft, and request approval. It must not directly place live trades, change risk thresholds, bypass tool permissions, bypass RiskGovernor, bypass the kill switch, or bypass audit logging.

Final rule:

```text
Chat is the interface.
CEO is the coordinator.
Tools are the safety boundary.
Services are the business logic.
RiskGovernor protects the account.
Audit records everything.
Human Board approves high-impact actions.
```
